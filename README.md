# Car-PowerPoint-Presentation

Create a presentation about a car with a maximum price of £50,000. Ensure the presentation is no 
longer than 5 minutes and you have used different features and techniques to display your Microsoft 
PowerPoint skills. The steps below are just general guidelines, you can adjust the number of slides,
content, and order in any way you deem appropriate:

1. Create a professional looking title page with a title that includes the name of your car. Also, 
use any form of media to introduce your car to the audience. Ensure you include a footer for 
all pages with the title, date, and page number.
2. For your first content slide, mention the reasons you have picked your car over other cars or 
if there was another car you were considering and why you did not choose it (e.g., Chose an 
electric car over a petrol car as it is more environmentally friendly)
3. Add another slide where you include some figures (miles per gallon, engine size etc.) and 
compare it to another car that is popular with consumers.
4. Summarise the key points of your presentation in a final conclusion slide.

Your presentation should include the following features:
• Images
• Videos
• Shapes 
• Icons
• Grouping
• Layering
• A table
• A chart
• Speaker note
